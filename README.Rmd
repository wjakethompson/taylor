## Overview

The goal of taylor is to provide easy access to a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. Data comes [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and the [SoundStat API](https://soundstat.info).

## Installation

You can install the released version of taylor from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("taylor")
```

To install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) use:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wjakethompson/taylor")
```

## Example

There are three main data sets.
The first is `taylor_album_songs`, which includes lyrics and audio features from the SoundStat API for all songs on Taylor's official studio albums.
Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., "Only the Young", "Christmas Tree Farm", etc.) and EPs (e.g., *Beautiful Eyes*).
However, now that Taylor [owns all her masters](https://www.taylorswift.com/read-my-letter/), both the original and Taylor's Version are included for albums that were rerecorded (e.g., both *Fearless* and *Fearless (Taylor's Version)* are present).

```{r album-songs}
taylor_album_songs
```

You can access Taylor's entire discography with `taylor_all_songs`. This includes all of the songs in `taylor_album_songs` plus EPs, individual singles, and songs where Taylor is credited as a featured artist or writer.

```{r all-songs}
taylor_all_songs
```

Finally, there is a small data set, `taylor_albums`, summarizing Taylor's album release history.

```{r albums}
taylor_albums
```
