[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile

[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've played for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating myself
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me

[Chorus]
My boy (My boy) only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen (I'm queen) of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
My boy (My boy) only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Once I fix me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) He's gonna miss me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Once I fix me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) He's gonna miss me

[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Stole my tortured heart (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Left all these broken parts (Oh-oh)
Told me I'm better off (Oh-oh)
But I'm not (Oh-oh)
I'm not, I'm not
