[Intro]
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)

[Verse 1]
I saw, in my mind, fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones got the chill
I stopped tryin' to make him laugh, stopped tryin' to drill the safe

[Chorus]
Thinkin', how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone

[Verse 2]
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gone, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

[Chorus]
For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone

[Bridge]
And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dyin' grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there

[Chorus]
So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?

[Verse 3]
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

[Chorus]
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)
But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone)
Two (Two) graves (Graves), one gun (Gun)
You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone
