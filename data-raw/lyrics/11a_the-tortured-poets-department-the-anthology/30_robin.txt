[Verse 1]
Long may you reign
You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense
You have no idea

[Pre-Chorus]
Strings tied to levers
Slowed-down clocks tethered
All this showmanship
To keep it for you in sweetness

[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you

[Verse 2]
Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried down deep and out of your reach
The secret we all vowed
To keep it from you in sweetness

[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you

[Bridge]
You got the dragonflies above your bed
You have a favorite spot on the swing set
You have no room in your dreams for regrets
(You have no idea)
The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
But now we'll curtail your curiosity
In sweetness

[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger (Way to go, tiger)
Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
Wilder and lighter
For you
