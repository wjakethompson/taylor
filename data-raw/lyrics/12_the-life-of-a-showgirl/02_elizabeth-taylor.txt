[Intro]
Elizabeth Taylor
Do you think it's forever?

[Verse 1]
That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée
Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me
All the right guys promised they'd stay
Under bright lights, they withered away
But you bloom
Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if your letters ever said, "Goodbye"

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY whеn Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been numbеr one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Verse 2]
Hey-ey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?
Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust (Just kidding)
We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's
They say I'm bad news, I just say, "Thanks"
And you
Look at me like you're hypnotized, and I think you know why

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ever leave me high and dry

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have (Uh) you

[Post-Chorus]
Elizabeth Taylor (Oh)
Do you think it's forever? (Oh)
If I can't have you

[Bridge]
(Ah) All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
(Ah) In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
(Ah) All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
(Ah) Don't you ever end up anything but mine

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)

[Outro]
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever (Elizabeth Taylor)
(Do you think it's forever?) In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine, oh
