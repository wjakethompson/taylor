[Verse 1]
I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
Have seen it before, they'll see it again (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong

[Chorus]
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

[Verse 2]
You couldn't understand it
Why you felt alone
You were in it for real
She was in her phone
And you were just a pose
And don't we try to love love? (Love, love)
We give it all we got (Give it all we got)
You finally left the table (Uh, uh)
And what a simple thought
You're starving 'til you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
Have messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
You move on

[Chorus]
And that's when I told you, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never met no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

[Bridge]
This is just
A storm inside a teacup
But shelter here with me, my love
Thunder like a drum
This life will beat you up, up, up, up
This is just
A temporary speed bump
But failure brings you freedom
And I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)

[Chorus]
Don't you sweat it, baby, it's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Oh, so sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never met no one like you before (No)
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
