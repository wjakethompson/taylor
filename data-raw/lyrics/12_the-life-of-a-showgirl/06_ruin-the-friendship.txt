[Verse 1]
Glistening grass from September rain
Gray overpass full of neon names
You drive (Mm, mm)
Eighty-five (Mm, mm)
Gallatin Road and the Lakeside Beach
Watching the game from your brother's Jeep
Your smile (Mm, mm)
Miles wide

[Chorus]
And it was not an invitation
Should've kissed you anyway
Should've kissed you anyway
And it was not convenient, no
But your girlfriend was away
Should've kissed you anyway, hey

[Verse 2]
Shiny wood floors underneath my feet
Disco ball makes everything look cheap
Have fun (Mm, mm)
It's prom (Mm, mm)
Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist
Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse
And see (Mm, mm)
You looking at me

[Chorus]
And it was not an invitation
But as the 50 Cent song played (Song played)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
And it was not (And it was not) convenient (Convenient), no
Would've been the best mistake
Should've kissed you anyway, hey

[Bridge]
Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should
Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should

[Verse 3]
When I left school, I lost track of you
Abigail called me with the bad news
Goodbye
And we'll never know why

[Chorus]
It was not an invitation
But I flew home anyway
With so much left to say
It was not convenient, no
But I whispered at the grave
"Should've kissed you anyway," ooh
And it was not (It was not) an invitation (Invitation)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway), anyway
And it was not-

[Post-Chorus]
My advice is always ruin the friendship
Better that than regret it for all time
Should've kissed you anyway
And my advice is always answer the question
Better that than to ask it all your life
Should've kissed you anyway

[Outro]
Should've kissed you anyway
