[Verse 1]
I heard you call me "Boring Barbie" when the coke's got you brave
High-fived my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me
Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face
Some people might be offended

[Chorus]
But it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you, ooh
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Verse 2]
Hadn't thought of you in a long time
But you keep sending me funny valentines
And I know you think it comes off vicious
But it's precious, adorable
Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse
That's how much it hurts
How many times has your boyfriend said
"Why are we always talking 'bout her?"

[Chorus]
It's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you, ooh
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Bridge]
You think I'm tacky, baby
Stop talking dirty to me
It sounded nasty, but it feels like you're flirting with me
I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it
It's kind of making me wet (Oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me (Ah)
It's honestly lovely
All the effort you've put in (Ah)
It's actually romantic
Really gotta hand it to you, to you
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Outro]
It's actually romantic (You've just given me so much attention; la-la-la-la)
It's actually romantic
(It's so) Shoo-wop-bop, romantic
