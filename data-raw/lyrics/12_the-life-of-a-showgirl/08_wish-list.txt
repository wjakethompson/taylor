[Verse 1]
They want that yacht life, under chopper blades
They want those bright lights and Balenci' shades
And a fat ass with a baby face
They want it all
They want that complex female character
They want that critical smash Palme d'Or
And an Oscar on their bathroom floor
They want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
Hope they get what they want

[Chorus]
I just want you, huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)
I just want you

[Verse 2]
They want that freedom, living off the grid
They want those three dogs that they call their kids
And that good surf, no hypocrites
They want it all
They want a contract with Real Madrid
They want that spring break that was fucking lit
And then that video taken off the internet
They want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
I hope they get what they want

[Chorus]
I just want you (You, you, yeah), huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (Ooh), wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop (Hoop)
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)

[Bridge]
I made wishes on all of the stars
Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot
I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not (I did not)
You caught me off my guard
I hope I get what I want (Get what I want)
'Cause I know what I want

[Chorus]
(I just, I just) I just want you, huh (Baby)
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (Got 'em lookin' like you) you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)
I just want you (Ooh)
And we could have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (You) you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (Yeah), wow
And now you got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)
I just want you
