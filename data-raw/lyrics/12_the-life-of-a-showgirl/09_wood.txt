[Verse 1]
Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not, he loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack and the black cat laughed

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine (Ah)
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood

[Chorus]
(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

[Verse 2]
Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm
To know a hard rock is on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
The curse on me was broken by your magic wand (Ah)
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood), I ain't gotta knock on wood

[Chorus]
(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my thighs
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my thighs
