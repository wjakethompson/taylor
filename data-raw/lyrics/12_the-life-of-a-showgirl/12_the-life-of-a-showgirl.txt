[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I waited by the stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name, then glowing like the end of a cigarette
Wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten
So you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
She was a menace
The baby of the family in Lenox
Her father whored around like all men did
Her mother took pills and played tennis

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
So she waited by the stage door as the club promoter arrived
She said, "I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine"
But that's not what showgirls get
They leave us for dead

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Sabrina Carpenter & Taylor Swift]
Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten
So you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck
I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect
Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away
And all the headshots on the walls
Of the dance hall are of the bitches
Who wish I'd hurry up and die
But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
I couldn't if I tried
So I say

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
"Thank you for the lovely bouquet
I'm married to the hustle
And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
And I'll never know another
Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace)
Sequins are forever
And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
Wouldn't have it any other way" (Wouldn't have it any other way)

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Oh, wouldn't have it any other way
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Hey, Kitty
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Now I make my money being pretty and witty
Thank you for the lovely bouquet

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
Thank you for an unforgettable night
We will see you next time
Give it up for the band
And the dancers
And of course, Sabrina
I love you, Taylor
That's our show, we love you so much
Good night
