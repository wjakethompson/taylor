[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special

[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
