[Chorus]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Chorus]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me

[Chorus]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
