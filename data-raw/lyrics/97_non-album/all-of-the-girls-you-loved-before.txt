[Verse 1]
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

[Refrain]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

[Verse 2]
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

[Refrain]
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
We're breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
That's why you're so amazing

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

[Bridge]
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

[Chorus]
The girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

[Outro]
(I love you more)
(I love you more)
