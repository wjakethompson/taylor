[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you
