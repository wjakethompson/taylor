[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Joy Williams, Taylor Swift]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & John Paul White]
Don't you dare look out your window, darlin', everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps ragin' on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Joy Williams, Taylor Swift]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Joy Williams & John Paul White, Taylor Swift & John Paul White, (Joy Williams), All]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Joy Williams]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Joy Williams & John Paul White]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
