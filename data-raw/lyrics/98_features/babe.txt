[Verse 1: Sugarland]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

[Pre-Chorus: Sugarland]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you "babe"

[Verse 2: Sugarland]
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Sugarland]
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, "No one else", how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time

[Bridge: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
Since you admitted it (oh), I keep picturin' (oh)
Her lips on your neck (oh), I can't unsee it (oh)
I hate that because of you (oh), I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe?
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

[Outro: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time
You said "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you "babe"
