[Verse 1: HAIM]
You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I
Never smoked a pack

[Chorus: HAIM]
Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad (Did me bad, did me bad)
And I did it back (Did it back, did it back)
You needed ass, well, what's
Wrong with that?

[Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
Gasoline (Gasoline), pretty please (Pretty please)
I want to get off (Gasoline)
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys (Throw the keys) back to me (Back to me)
Go on and kick off your boots (Gasoline)
In the passenger seat

[Bridge: HAIM, Taylor Swift, HAIM & Taylor Swift]
Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow
We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
Want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?
When you're lying between my legs it doesn't matter
Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?
Faster and faster

[Outro: HAIM]
Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
