[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus: John Mayer & Taylor Swift, John Mayer]
Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (Can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'til the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus: John Mayer & Taylor Swift, John Mayer]
Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (Can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart
With half of my heart

[Verse 3: John Mayer, Taylor Swift]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
With half of my-

[Chorus: John Mayer & Taylor Swift, John Mayer]
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you that
Half of my heart won't do

[Outro: John Mayer, John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
