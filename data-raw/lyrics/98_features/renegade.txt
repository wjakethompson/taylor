[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known how many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say, "Get your shit together so I can love you?"
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles ’cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say, "Get your shit together so I can love you?"
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might’ve let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn’t be the first renegade to need somebody

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
To need somebody, to need somebody, to need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say, "Get your shit together so I can love you?"
You come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?
