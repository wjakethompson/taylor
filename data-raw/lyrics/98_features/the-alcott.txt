[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
I get myself twisted in threads
To meet you at The Alcott
I'd go to the corner in the back
Where you'd always be
And there you are, sittin' as usual
With your golden notebook
Writing something about someone
Who used to be me

[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger]
And the last thing you wanted
Is the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
You tell me the truth
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger, Taylor Swift, Both]
I sit there silently
Waitin' for you to look up (Ah)
I see you smile
When you see it's me
I had to do something
To break into your golden thinking (Ah)
How many times will I do this
And you'll still believe? (Ah)

[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
It's the last thing you wanted
(Tell me, which side are you on, dear?)
It's the first thing you do
(Give me some tips to forget you)
You tell me your problems
(Have I become one of your problems?)
And I tell you the truth
(Could it be easy this once?)
It's the last thing you wanted
(Everything that's mine is a landmine)
It's the first thing I do
(Did my love aid and abet you?)
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you

[Bridge: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift]
And I'll ruin it all over
I'll ruin it for you
I'll ruin it all over
And over like I always do
I'll ruin it all over
(Why don't you rain on my parade?)
I'll ruin it for you
(Shred my evenin' gown)
I'll ruin it all over
(Read my sentence out loud)
And over like I always do
('Cause I love this curse on our house)

[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
It's the last thing I wanted
(Tell me, which side are you on, dear?)
It's the first thing I do
(Give me some tips to forget you)
I tell you my problems
(Have I become one of your problems?)
And you tell me the truth
(Could it be easy this once?)
It's the last thing I wanted
(Everything that's mine is a landmine)
It's the first thing I do
(Did my love aid and abet you?)
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love (Back in love)
Back in love with you

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
Back in love with you
