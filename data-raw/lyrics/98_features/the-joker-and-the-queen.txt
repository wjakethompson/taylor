[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I've been played before, if you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff (But you called my bluff)
And saw through all my tells (And saw through all my tells)
And then you went all in
And we left together

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And I know you think that what makes a king
Is gold, a palace, and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
