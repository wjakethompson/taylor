[Verse 1: Gracie Abrams]
I know you know
It felt just like a joke
I show, you don't
And now we're talkin'
I know your ghost
I see her through the smoke
She'll play her show
And you'll be watchin'

[Pre-Chorus: Gracie Abrams]
And if history's clear, someone always ends up in ruins
And what seemed like fate becomes "What the hell was I doin'?"
Babylon lovers hangin' lifetimes on a vine (Ooh)
Do you miss mine?

[Chorus: Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
Do you miss us, us?
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Us (Us), us (Us), us (Us)

[Verse 2: Gracie Abrams, Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
I know you know
It felt like somethin' old
It felt like somethin' holy, like souls bleedin', so
It fеlt like what I've known
You're twеnty-nine years old
So how can you be cold when I open my home?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
And if history's clear, the flames always end up in ashes
And what seemed like fate, give it ten months and you'll be past it (You'll be past it)
Babylon lovers hangin' missed calls on the line
I gave you mine

[Chorus: Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
Did you mind us, us?
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Us (Us), us (Us), us (Us)

[Bridge: Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
That night, you were talkin' false prophets and profits
They make in the margins of poetry sonnets
You never read up on it, shame, could've learned somethin'
Robert Bly on my nightstand, gifts from you, how ironic
The curse or a miracle, hearse or an oracle
You're incomparable, fuck, it was chemical
You (You) plus (Plus) me (Me) was

[Chorus: Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams]
Us, us, us
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Mistaken for strangers the way it was, was
The pain of, the reign of, the flame of us, us
The outline, well, sometimes, do you miss us, us?
The best kind, well, sometimes, do you miss us?
