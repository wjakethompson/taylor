[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 1]
Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 2]
And does she know
Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 3]
Life with me was a fairytale love
I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Bridge]
I heard you're gonna get married, have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Outro]
Of your life, oh, oh yeah
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me in your life
Oh, oh, yeah
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
