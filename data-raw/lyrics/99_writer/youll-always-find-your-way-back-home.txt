[Intro]
Woo!

[Verse 1]
You wake up
It’s raining and it’s Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time’s up
You’re late again, so get out the door (Out the door)
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance-floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when the lights go down, it’s the ending of the show (Show)
And you’re feeling like you got nowhere to go
Don’t you know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes
You can say "goodbye," and you can say "hello"
But you’ll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
You’ll always find your way back home

[Verse 2]
Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around (Turn around)
'Cause this world is big and it’s crazy (It's crazy)
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about (Dream about)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause when I’m feeling down and I am all alone
(And I am all alone)
I’ve always got a place where I can go
'Cause I know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes
You can say “goodbye,” and you can say “hello”
But you’ll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams (Chase your dreams)
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (Everybody knows)
You’ll always find your way back home

[Bridge]
Where they know exactly who you are
Back home, where the real you is the superstar
Back home, you know it’s never too far away
[Breakdown]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes
You can say “goodbye,” and you can say “hello”
But you’ll always find your way back

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes (that’s just the way it goes)
You can say “goodbye,” and you can say “hello” (Say “hello”)
But you’ll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (Everybody knows)
You’ll always find your way back home

[Outro]
You’ll always find your way back home
You’ll always find your way back home
You’ll always find your way back home
You’ll always find your way back home
You’ll always, you'll always find your way
You’ll always find your way (Back home) back home
